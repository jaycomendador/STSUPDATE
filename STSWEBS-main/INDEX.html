          <p>While mosquito bites account for only a small percentage of the total number of deaths in the world each day, they are nonetheless a significant concern in some African countries.

          <p>Of the 241 million malaria cases that occurred in the country in 2020, 627,000 of them ended in death. A World Health Organization Fact Sheet this disease originates from female Anopheles mosquitos infected by malaria. It is treatable and preventable, however.</p>

        <p class = "a">Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, continues to significantly impact tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. As of April 2024, over 7.6 million cases have been reported globally, with the Americas experiencing a marked increase. Children, often more vulnerable to severe symptoms, remain a key demographic in these statistics</p><br>
        <a class = "HTH1" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2024/06/13/default-calendar/dengue--current-epidemiological-situation-and-response">Manila Bulletin</a><br>
        <p class = "a">In the Philippines, dengue remains a significant public health concern, with a notable increase in cases this year. As of September 2024, over 208,000 dengue cases were reported, marking a substantial rise compared to the previous year. This includes a 33% increase in cases from the first half of the year compared to 2023. However, the case fatality rate has slightly improved, with 396 deaths reported by mid-year, compared to 421 during the same period last year</p>

        <p class = "a">In Calbayog City, Samar, dengue cases have significantly increased in 2024. From January to mid-August, the city recorded 422 cases, a dramatic rise compared to just 83 cases during the same period in 2023. Two dengue-related deaths have been reported this year. Out of the city’s 157 villages, 57 have been affected, including 20 within the city proper.
            <br>
          To combat this surge, Calbayog City was declared under a state of calamity, enabling the allocation of emergency response funds. Local authorities have intensified efforts such as clean-up drives to destroy mosquito breeding sites and implementing measures to protect children in schools. Residents are encouraged to follow dengue prevention strategies, including the 5S approach: search and destroy mosquito habitats, practice self-protection, seek early medical consultation, support fogging operations, and maintain hydration</p>
